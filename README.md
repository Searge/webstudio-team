Project based on [final homework](https://github.com/Searge/goit-markup-hw-08), but remastered a little.

Specifically:

- split into partitions;
- Sass files got rid of many functions and it was decided to abandon dictionaries in favor of
  variables;
- contact page has been added;
- responsive markup, as far as the layout allowed.
